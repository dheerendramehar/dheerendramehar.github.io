Hi, my name is Dheerendra. I graduated in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur.
I am blessed with a beautiful & lovely family, and I love to spend time with them.  

My circle often call me ```echo $(tr A-Za-z N-ZA-Mn-za-m <<< QuvehOunv)```. This is, how i look in ASC-II art.

I did my eduction till High School from My Village. 
I was lucky enough to be awarded as topper for all three Board Exams of 8th, 10th and 12th Standards with 93.67%, 90.17%, 89.85% respectively. Turns out that all the three times, it was a village record.
After that i got B.Tech. admission in Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

If you ask me what do you like. My answer will always be "I love to do things, I can't sit doing nothing." 

During my college days, i was doing simulations in Matlab and PSpice for experiments related to power electronics. 
In free time, I was making RC Planes, flying and designing them. We have secured first position in Aviator Design Challenge-Techfest 2014 IIT Bombay, First
position is Cruise Control-Techkriti 2015 IIT Kanpur and many more achievements in Aeromodelling. I mentored junior students, organized Aeromodelling Workshops and did many more things.

My favorite sport is Swimming.

I am so addicted to Internet and technology that i can't sit a single minute without it.
I always wonder, how will this world look like without technology.

Currently i am exploring the world of DevOps and Trading.
